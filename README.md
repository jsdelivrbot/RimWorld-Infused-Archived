A unique way to make unique items for your special colonists: Randomly enchants equipment.

## Features
### Varying infusions for everyone
All weapons and apparels(Except personal shield) have a chance to get infused. They will have its own label, various stat buffs and color coded overlay. Note that enemies might carry infused equipment too.
### Stat bonuses
A infusion grants an item many minor bonuses, including melee damage, ranged accuracy, attack speed, movement speed, global work speed, specific job speed bonus and more.
### Fully customizable
If you don't like something or want to add your own infusion, go to InfusionDefs folder and edit it. All infusions can be deleted and modified via XML. No C# knowledge required.

## F.A.Q.
### Can I install this on existing colonies?
Yes, you can use Infused with your ongoing game.
### Can I use this with (random mod)?
Unless it redefines any of Core StatDef. You can still able to use both, but either infusion bonus will not work, or (random mod)'s overwrite will be undone.
